euweb forum software
https://rapideuphoria.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rapideuphoria/tools/euweb/trunk

Dependencies:
=======================

edbi       http://jeremy.cowgar.com/svn/edbi/trunk
webclay2   http://jeremy.cowgar.com/svn/webclay2/trunk

The edbi and webclay2 files are included like:

    include edbi/edbi.e
    include webclay/webclay.e as wc

Therefore, they should be put into a directory called "edbi" or
"webclay", respectively that is a subdirectory of a directory 
in the include path (configurable via eu.cfg file, -i flags 
on the command line or EUDIR) or of the euweb source directory.


Configuration
=======================

Read source/config.e.  Create your own configuration file and include it from
source/config.e inside an ifdef.  A sample config file might look like:

        public constant DB_DRIVERS_PATH = "drivers"
        public constant DB_URL = "mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database_name"

        -- Do NOT include the trailing slash
        public constant ROOT_URL = "http://localhost"

        public constant AUTO_LOGIN_UID = 0 -- 0 disables, otherwise set to your UID

        -- reCAPTCHA keys
        public constant RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = ""
        public constant RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = ""


Database
=========================

euweb uses a MySQL database, so you'll need to have the MySQL server installed.
